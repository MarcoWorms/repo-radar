RepoRadar can monitor multiple GitHub orgs to find any newly open PRs, summarizes everything from title to diff using LLMs and post them in a telegram chat. This allows you to create automated informational feeds for any ecosystem where changes are proposed through code.

## Sponsor

Today RepoRadar operational costs are starting to get expensive for me to pay just by myself (about 10$ every day), so I'm opening this channel so people can contribute to funds that will be used to pay LLM bills, like OpenAI in this current version. With enough funds, I could:

- Upgrade gpt3.5 to gpt4 and try to make the feed even better (but costs could easily go up 10x to 20x)
- Add new orgs to the current monitor is also increases costs
- Have more orgs in the list for DeFi monitoring

As for new features, I'd also like to expand the code to be able to take the entire repo into consideration to know whether a change is relevant in a wider context, as well as detect commits that were not sent through PRs, there is also a need to figure out how to do filtering at telegram so very important changes don't get lost in lots of smaller ones.

So if you believe this can be useful and want to incentivize this research by funding the operational costs, I appreciate your sponsorship!
